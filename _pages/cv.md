# Intro

My career started as an **electronic engineer**, understanding how technology works from the transistor level. With a strong base of structured programming languages applied directly to microprocessors firmware, I've been able to continue learning higher level programming languages consciously, always trying to find the equilibrium between ease of implementation and performance required for each use case.

Above all I am a **technologist**. I know and accept that in the IT industry things move faster than a single engineer can learn, but I do my best at staying up to date in the topics I am interested in and are useful for my current position, always reading and implementing new things in personal projects I use to finish understanding new concepts. What makes me a good technologist is my enthusiasm for learning new, alternative, or more efficient ways of solving problems we might already have an answer for.

Today I am focused on how the **infrastructure** is designed to run highly scalable and reliable applications in conjunction with the cloud, but I also really enjoy the design and development process of the application itself, which allows me to connect the challenges between the two worlds and successfully deliver a great end-to-end solution.
