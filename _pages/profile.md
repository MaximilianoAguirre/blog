## Howdy! ðŸ‘‹ and welcome to the nerdy part of my life. 

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/roles.svg" alt="roles" class="align-right" id="roles">

I've been called by many names in the tech world, cause I usually am what the circumstances need.

But above all I am a guy who loves problem solving and extreme sports in equal parts. What a combination, right?!

Well, I've found in remote work the ability to balance these two worlds, and I love it!

Enough of me, I hope you enjoy this blog, which intends to be a collection of didactic posts showing random tech stuff I've learnt while working, playing or even just reading.

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have a fun idea for a post or simply want to talk about any of the things that are posted here, I always like a good nerdy conversation ðŸ¤“.

See ya!
